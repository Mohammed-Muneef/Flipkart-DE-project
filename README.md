# Flipkart Data Engineering Project using PySpark

## Overview
This project focuses on building an efficient and scalable **data pipeline** to process and analyze Flipkart's e-commerce data using **PySpark**. The project demonstrates how big data tools and techniques can be leveraged to handle large datasets, optimize performance, and derive actionable insights.

## Project Structure
- **Data Ingestion**: Load Flipkart data from CSV files into PySpark DataFrames for further processing.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Perform necessary data cleansing steps such as handling missing values, duplicates, and standardizing data formats. Apply transformations to enrich the dataset and prepare it for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze customer behavior, product trends, and sales performance to generate meaningful insights.
- **Scalability & Optimization**: Ensure the pipeline is optimized for both batch and real-time data processing, leveraging PySpark's distributed computing power.

## Features
- Load CSV data into Spark DataFrames with schema inference.
- Perform data preprocessing, including:
  - Handling missing or null values.
  - Type casting and formatting.
  - Removing duplicates.
- Implement data transformations such as:
  - Calculating key metrics (e.g., sales, revenue, order frequency).
  - Creating new features for analysis (e.g., customer segments).
- Analyze large volumes of data efficiently using PySparkâ€™s distributed framework.
- Ensure scalability for real-time and batch processing of data.

## Technology Stack
- **PySpark**: For distributed data processing and analysis.
- **Databricks/Apache Spark**: Cluster management and execution.
- **CSV/Parquet**: Input/output file formats.
- **DBFS (Databricks File System)**: Data storage layer.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For code execution and visualization.


## Running the Project
1. Open your **PySpark/Databricks** environment.
2. Load the data into a DataFrame using PySpark:
   ```python
   flipkart_df = spark.read.format("csv").option("header", "true").option("inferSchema", "true").load("/path/to/Flipkart.csv")
   ```
3. Perform data cleaning and transformations as outlined in the project.
4. Run analysis to generate insights, metrics, and visualizations.

## Output
The project will generate insights such as:
- Sales trends across different categories.
- Customer purchasing behavior and frequency.
- Revenue trends and performance analysis.
